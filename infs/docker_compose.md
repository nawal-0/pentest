## Docker Compose Commands

### UP
> docker-compose up [options] [--scale SERVICE=NUM] [SERVICE...]

- Builds, creates, start and attaches to containers for a service
- Important Options:
    - '-d' - keep all container running in background
    - '--build' - force to rebuild the image
    - '--no-recreate' - ignore existing running containers and start all stopped containers
    - '--force-recreate' - force Compose to stop and recreate all containers
    - '--no-deps -d SERVICE_NAME' - stop, recreate and restart a specific container
